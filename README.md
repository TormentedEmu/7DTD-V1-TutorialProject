# 7DTD-V1-TutorialProject
A Unity project template designed to assist modders in adding new features to the game 7 Days To Die Version 1.0

If you do not own the DuckType Jiggle asset from Unity, I highly recommend it and it's only 7 usd.  If you don't then remove the references to these scripts from the Unity Project.
